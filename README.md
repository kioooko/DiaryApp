"Shizuku" is a simple diary application. The simple yet beautiful design and easy-to-use intuitive interface make it easy to keep a diary. Your record is a treasure, and you can look back on it at any time to relive past experiences.

Shizuku is also integrated with iCloud. This allows you to seamlessly share your records among all your devices. You can capture and save your memories instantly without wasting time.

Weather information is a great way to make your recordings even more vivid; Shizuku automatically records the weather using your location. This places your experience in a more tangible context, making your recordings more real and vivid.

Tracking your daily habits is another important feature of Shizuku. Using checklists, you can track your daily tasks and habits and visualize your personal growth.

Shizuku is the perfect place to tell your story. Take your day by day and use your journal as a tool for growth and learning!

時間を過ごすこと、感じることはAIにはできない人間だけのものです。
全ての経験を大事にしましょう。
